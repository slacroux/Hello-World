Learning About Github
1. Repository
A repository is used to organize a project. They can contain files, images, videos and other kind of data.
The Readme file is included, it should contain information about the project.
2. Branch
Branching is a way to work different versions of a repository. You can experiment on a branch of the master before actually 
make a committing to it, because a branch of the master is a copy of it. And if new chages where made on the master you can 
pull then to the copy of it.
3. Commits
It is how you call the changes made and saved on branch. With each commit there is a commit message, it should contain a explanation
abou those changes made, why they were made, so others can understand what you did there.
